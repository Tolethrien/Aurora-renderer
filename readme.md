Aurora 1.0

Aurora is a 2D rendering engine built on top of the WebGPU and written entirely in TypeScript.
It was originally developed as the rendering backend for the Misa game engine, but it is designed to work equally well as a standalone library for any chromium-based project that requires small and fast 2D graphics.

Core Capabilities

Aurora provides a modern GPU-accelerated 2D rendering pipeline with:

- Multi-shader 2d rendering based on sprites and shapes.

- Depth sorting with Z-buffer.

- High-quality text rendering â€” with MSDF (Multi-channel Signed Distance Field).

- Fully GPU-driven lighting.

- HDR color,bloom effects with color correction and toneMapping.

- GPU stats.

- UI rendering

### Note!

    WebGPU is in experimental state, it may not work on every devices and show weird behavior. It is recommended to use it on chromium-based browsers or projects like electron
